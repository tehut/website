On Friday 5 June 2015 I gave a talk called [Cluster Management with Kubernetes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H4ywDb4vAJeg8KEjpYfhNqFSig0Q8e_X5I36kM9S6q0/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) to a general audience at the University of Edinburgh. The talk includes an example of a music store system with a Kibana front end UI and an Elasticsearch based back end which helps to make concrete concepts like pods, replication controllers and services. Please use the gears on the bottom row to select speaker notes.
